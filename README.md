# Mapping Earthquakes Analysis

## Overview of Mapping Earthquakes Analysis

The purpose of the Mapping Earthquakes Analysis was to create an interactive, dynamic webpage designed to map earthquakes by visualizing:

  - All earthquake data captured within the past 7 days 
  - Tectonic plate data
  - Major earthquake data with three ranges of magnitudes (greater than 6, greater than 5, and less than 5) captured within the past 7 days

Visitors are able to select each of the above visualizations on the webpage using a control feature at the upper right hand corner of the page. Additionally, visitors can select from the following 3 base map layers:
  - Streets 
  - Satellite Streets
  - Dark
